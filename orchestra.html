  <h1>Orchestra!</hi>
  <pre> <img src ="pres.png" style="float: right; width: 150px; height: 225px; border: 8px solid black">
  Like most people, I've been in orchestra since 4th grade
  This year, I'm in 1st hour and am one of the many orchestra presidents</pre>
  <p id="c"> <img src ="chair.png" style="float: left; width: 150px; height: 150px;">
    9 year old me chose to play the cello over the other instruments because I thought that only cellists got to sit,
    so I was severely dissapointed walking into my first class and seeing enough chairs for everyone. </p>
  <p id="c"> However, I don't regret my choice because I love the sound of the cello far more
    than any of the other instruments. </p>
  <p id="c"> The last few years I've really fallen in love with orchestra! Starting this year I'm going to be volunteering at
    the Cody Elementary and MNMS because I do think that music is important for kids to be involved in. </p>
